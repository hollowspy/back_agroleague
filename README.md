## Instruction

- Clone this repository on your local machine. (with a git clone for exemple). 
- After, made a `npm install` to install project. 
- run `npm run dev`. Your project is running on `http://localhost:8089`. Please be carrefull. If you wan't to use this project with the front-end project in the same time [Project here](https://github.com/hollowspy/front_agroleague), you have de run the back on port 8089. Thanks to apply this instruction. 
    If the 8089 port is already running, you could kill your port on your local machine, and re run `npm run dev`. 
    Otherwise, you could change the port in `index.ts` file. But, in the same time, you have to change, the url in front-end project in `request-service.ts` file. 
- Your project is running



### TODO
 New features we could develop : 
 - Make the search on OmdAPI with more fields (as year for example)
 - You can sort datas by a field. For exemple, if you want to sort data by dates, rating or another field. We could use query params to know by which field we want to sort data

ENJOY :)
